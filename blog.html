            <p>I think about killing myself alot. The healthcare guy is hot. I'm nauesous. Speling is my specialty. I wonder if i'll ever make it or simply fade away. i hate having to rely on myself because i am truly useless. i think about killing myself. maybe i will, but probably not. im just being edgy right now or whatever, but this is my fucking blog so whatever. i sobbed earlier because my cat will never be as small and cute as he is right now, and he will die one day. i do not know how to process anything. i think about killing myself. i worry so much I am going to fail this class, and many others. is it even worth it? is anything really worth it. our earth crumbles around us, and i do not know how to fix it. i do not know many things, i fear. there are so many things i used to enjoy-now i just sleep all day and regret wasting my time. i have little time left, i fear. whatever, im silly. also ive decided not to use capitals for this post. magazines make me sad.</p>
            <p>im gonna go watch internet pornography</p>

        <article class="post-content">
            <p>I'm not so sure what to write here anyways, I've been severely negelecting this blog for a multitude of months now. Not much has changed, and I fear that I may be stagnating entirely. It is hard to be so young, oftentimes I believe my life has completely passed me by before i even let it begin. Motivation is also increasingly difficult to come by, I often wonder if this is truly what I want out of life. However, I am not proud of my progress this semester. Junior year was incredibly difficult and I fear that I may have to retake a class if my professor does not let me submit a few assignments late, and I fear that she will not let that happen. Too little, too late. I constantly find myself like this every semester, wishing things will be different. However, a feeble soul has only wishes and notions of dreams. It is high time i put on my big girl pants and actually start to get shit done, and start working towards my future. I want to be in cybersecurity. I want to work hard, I want many things. It is only me that can do this, and I have to decided if I'm truly okay with being mediocre and coasting through life, letting it pass me by. Or if It is finally time for me to fucking get it together. Idk, things are tough right now. I'll try to update more regularly, or not. We will see if my habit of continually abandoning projects and never finishing anything continues.</p>
            <p>I am also really lonely, sometimes I find it so hard to believe in myself, and always continue to do things so incredibly, By Myself. I have always been alone and prided on how much I need and enjoy time with myself, but sometimes it feels weird. I do not like being alone so much anymore, but I cannot continue to just sit idly by and hope a relationship will fall into my lap, or to focus on it so continually. I just fear that the sun of my life is already setting-this soon.</p>

        <article class="post-content">
            <p>So here I am, stuck at the airport. I am currently watching a man in a gucci fanny pack drop blueberries on the ground as he shoves them into his gaping maw. Now he just pulled out some sweaty cheese and is eating it by the handful. What an animal. He dsicussed the silent majority, and honesrly I think bro is on steriods because he is a sad, middle aged freak. Freak of the week, if you will. Or freak of the airport considering the extenuating circumstances. This cheese freak of the week.</p>
            <p>He finished the cheese, now left with a glass tupperware container he tucks into his large, unneccesary yeti cooler. This man's Prada sneakers are far too clean to be worn anywhere but equinox. His friend is hot. Continuing their conversation, he details the writing of instagram scripts. Lord knows what these are, and he boastfully comments on how it is too easy to come up with content. Jesus weeps for simpler times, and for less goobers to populate Denver International Airport. And for the love of god, how does a man with so much fake drip not know how to figure out time zone differences.</p>
            <p>Blueberries lie desolate on the unforgiving, grey patterened carpet.</p>

            <p>well, i suppose this begins my blog, diary, progress update notepad thing. i don't exactly know what i'll document here, but i enjoy the process.</p>
            <p>today, obviously, i began my portfolio. i am inspired by a friend to learn CSS as quickly as possible, so i can begin with java. i've had some fun with the fonts, however i'm currently working on updating them and adding some more cyberpunk like designs. for now though, i think it'll do.</p>
            <p>i'm a little stuck on what services to start offering. i'd ideally like to keep a stylized, early 2000s era website, however that is not exactly considered professional or acessible to modern audiences. strange. i like to take inspiration from japanese web design, as strange as it seems. their sites often appear clunky, cluttered, full of information, colors and pictures. it speaks to their culture of informed buying decisions, however i just find the aesthetics themselves interesting. anywhoo.</p>
